                        Hiiiii :3 I'm Miau. I like engineering and computers. I have somewhat of an obsession with
                        factorio at 1300+ hours played in 3 years. I am also learning German and Japanese on Duolingo.

                            I am here today to add a new feature to the <a href="silly.html">SILLY</a> page, so that when you click/hover over the PISS sticker, it will change the background to that sticker. :3
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am planning on adding a bunch of stuff to the <a href="factorio.html">Factorio</a> page, but i haven't gotten around to it bc it sounds like a lot of work &colon;&lpar;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am also <i>going to</i> add a list and pictures to the <a href="cats.html">Cats</a> page

                        <p>
                            I've been in my first actual semester of college for the past 2 months, which is part of why I haven't been working on this. I really enjoy my comp sci class, even though I should probably be in a higher level class. If I could, I would only do this class (computers :3). I am also in a calculus 1 class, most of which I already learned in high school :/. My art appreciation class is quite interesting, learning about different paints, how they're made, what they excel in, etc. I really don't like my english class and I can't wait until I don't have to take any more.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ok 2 hours later and I have added background effects to some of the stamps and stickers. (I don't think all of them need/deserve it)
                            When you click on a sticker, for example the one that says piss, it will toggle that image as the background. The set of backgrounds at the bottom use a different method that I completely stole from <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/webmastery/downloads/tiledbgs">sadgrl</a>, which will have a preview of a background while you hover your cursor over it.

                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Tried using python with flask to simplify adding new pages, but it didn't work out &colon;&lpar;</p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Added a new page called <a href="silly.html">Silly</a></p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Added a bunch of stamps and buttons to <a href="silly.html">Silly</a></p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Finally added art to <a href="art.html">Art</a>. I have drawings of my cat Sassy, Adeptus Mechanicus artwork, memes I drew during math class, a marker tattoo I made a while ago, and some digital art</p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Fixed tab titles, added a metadata description, and added a tab favicon

                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;I finished my first college course recently. I had CIS-1A, an introduction to
                        computer systems and microsoft office. It was pretty easy and I can't wait to start my fall
                        term. I'm gonna have C++ programming, Calculus I, English comp, and Art appreciation.</p>
                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;I made a new page today that I've been thinking about adding for a week now: <a
                            href="breakthroughs.html">Breakthroughs</a>. I want a place
                        where I can just put down my thoughts.</p>
                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;The supervisor of a summer program I've gone to for a few years suggested a
                        scholarship I should apply for, along with giving me a letter of recomendation. I started the
                        application process today, but got too tired half way through</p>

                        The first version of my personal website, made for the Harvard CS50 class. I'm making this
                        personal site to learn HTML/CSS, and because I love how creative people are with their personal
                        websites. I also don't like social media and this just feels better.
