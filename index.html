                        Hiiiii :3 I'm Miau. I like engineering and computers. I have somewhat of an obsession with
                        factorio at 1500+ hours played in 3 years. I am also learning German and Japanese on Duolingo.

                        I showed off this site to a friend recently, and she said she was disappointed the background 
                        from <a href="silly.html">Silly</a> didn't stay when she changed pages, so I used some of what 
                        I learned from my computer science projects this semester, along with looking at how 
                        <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/" target="_blank">this person</a> did their themes, to make 
                        the images load on other pages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How it works is, on <a href="silly.html">Silly</a>, when you click an available image, it 
                        stores the file name in local storage as "background". Then, whenever a page is loaded, it 
                        changes the background image to whatever that clicked image was. This took far longer than it 
                        needed to, but I learned a lot about using local storage instead of cookies. ^-^

                        Hey hey people, I have updated my factorio hours up top (1300->1500), which is currently at 
                        1561 hours. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I updated the cgit stylesheet to fix some color issues, such as the code being black text 
                        on a dark gray background.

                        I sent my all of the programs I made while doing Harvard's cs50 course to my git page.

                        I have wanted to host my website myself for a while now,
                        and I finally got to it and started following <a href="https://Landchad.net">LandChad's

                        Today I did some pondering (I sat outside on my couch for an hour after getting an hour of sleep) on the relationship betweeen pay, effort, and skill of jobs. I started out with a disconnect between the physical effort of a job and how well it pays, such as the difference between physical labor (I think of farming) and office work. I do realize that the development of a skill should correspond to an increased pay, but it still feels weird to me that there's an inverse correlation between the physical effort of a job and how well it pays. (I beleive high level skills (doctors, artisans) should be rewarded for their abilities, its just that office work feels strange to me)

                    <p>I also added a picture of "Chad" to <a href="cats.html">Cats</a>

                            I've been in my first actual semester of college for the past 2 months, which is part of why I haven't been working on this. I really enjoy my comp sci class, even though I should probably be in a higher level class. If I could, I would only do this class (computers :3). I am also in a calculus 1 class, most of which I already learned in high school :/. My art appreciation class is quite interesting, learning about different paints, how they're made, what they excel in, etc. I really don't like my english class and I can't wait until I don't have to take any more.

                            ok 2 hours later and I have added background effects to some of the stamps and stickers. (I don't think all of them need/deserve it)
                            When you click on a sticker, for example the one that says piss, it will toggle that image as the background. The set of backgrounds at the bottom use a different method that I completely stole from <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/webmastery/downloads/tiledbgs">sadgrl</a>, which will have a preview of a background while you hover your cursor over it.

                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Added a new page called <a href="silly.html">Silly</a></p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Added a bunch of stamps and buttons to <a href="silly.html">Silly</a></p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Finally added art to <a href="art.html">Art</a>. I have drawings of my cat Sassy, Adeptus Mechanicus artwork, memes I drew during math class, a marker tattoo I made a while ago, and some digital art</p>
                        <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;Fixed tab titles, added a metadata description, and added a tab favicon

                    <p>Wow it's already been a month and I haven't done anything on here.</p>
                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;I finished my first college course recently. I had CIS-1A, an introduction to
                        computer systems and microsoft office. It was pretty easy and I can't wait to start my fall
                        term. I'm gonna have C++ programming, Calculus I, English comp, and Art appreciation.</p>
                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;I made a new page today that I've been thinking about adding for a week now: <a
                            href="breakthroughs.html">Breakthroughs</a>. I want a place
                        where I can just put down my thoughts.</p>
                    <p>&DDotrahd;&nbsp;The supervisor of a summer program I've gone to for a few years suggested a
                        scholarship I should apply for, along with giving me a letter of recomendation. I started the
                        application process today, but got too tired half way through</p>

                        The first version of my personal website, made for the Harvard CS50 class. I'm making this
                        personal site to learn HTML/CSS, and because I love how creative people are with their personal
                        websites. I also don't like social media and this just feels better.
